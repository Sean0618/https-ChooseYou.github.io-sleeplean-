      <h2>7 Nighttime Habits to Support Fat Loss</h2>
      <p>Fat loss isn’t just about what you do during the day—it’s about how you treat your body at night. These seven habits help your body rest, recover, and burn fat more efficiently while you sleep:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stick to a consistent bedtime to regulate fat-burning hormones</li>
        <li>Avoid late-night snacking to prevent insulin spikes</li>
        <li>Stay hydrated throughout the day, but taper off before bed</li>
        <li>Dim the lights to signal melatonin release</li>
        <li>Wind down with calming activities like stretching or journaling</li>
        <li>Keep your room cool, dark, and quiet for deeper sleep</li>
        <li>Power down screens to avoid blue light disruption</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sleep Away</h2>
      <p>Your body does some of its most powerful work while you sleep. If you’re serious about resetting your health, reclaiming your energy, and building a sustainable lifestyle, it’s time to rethink your nights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to bed and wake up at the same time daily to stabilize metabolism</li>
        <li>Lower cortisol before sleep with breathwork or reflection</li>
        <li>Cool, dark, quiet environments promote deep fat-burning sleep</li>
        <li>Finish meals 2–3 hours before bed to avoid insulin spikes</li>
        <li>Turn off screens 30–60 minutes before sleep to support melatonin</li>
        <li>Hydrate smartly—don’t overload before bed</li>
        <li>Reframe sleep as strategic recovery, not laziness</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Fuel to Burn: How to Eat for Sustainable Fat Loss</h2>
      <p>Fat loss isn’t just about cutting calories—it’s about feeding your body the right way so it can reset, recover, and burn efficiently. When paired with restorative sleep and consistent nighttime habits, your food choices become a powerful tool for metabolic clarity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prioritize whole foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, and lean proteins</li>
        <li>Load up on fiber to support digestion and hormone balance</li>
        <li>Eat the rainbow—colorful veggies offer antioxidant support</li>
        <li>Practice portion awareness without shame or restriction</li>
        <li>Time meals earlier in the day to support sleep and metabolism</li>
        <li>Hydrate with intention—start early, taper off before bed</li>
        <li>Eat to empower your body, not to punish it</li>
